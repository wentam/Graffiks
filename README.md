#### It's a graphics engine

There is a clear difference between a graphics engine and a game engine. Graffiks is a graphics engine.

This does not mean you cannot make games with graffiks. In fact, it's the intention that you do. By separating graphics
and game engine you gain a lot of flexibility. See the [wiki page on philosophy](https://github.com/wentam/Graffiks/wiki/Philosophy)
